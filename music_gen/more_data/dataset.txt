This is not intended for dancing to!  See colinhume.com/inst0.htm#FiveMinute
Variations on the country dance tune "The Phoenix" published by John Playford in 1670.
The first two bars mimic the excellent 1970's recording by the band Orange and Blue,
still used by folk dance clubs in England.
After that many strange things happen, including a snatch of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.

W:Chorus: She's the sweetest rose of color this soldier ever knew,
W:Her eyes are bright like diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
W:You may talk about your dearest May and sing of Rosa Lee,
W:But the Yellow Rose of Texas is the only girl for me.

W:When  the  Rio Grande is flowing, and the starry skies are bright
W:She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
W:She thinks if I remember, when we parted long ago,
W:I promised to come back again and not to leave her so
W:
W:Oh, now I'm going to find her, for my heart is full of woe
W:And we'll sing the song together, that we sang so long ago
W:We'll play the banjo gaily, and we'll sing the songs of yore,
W:And the Yellow Rose of Texas shall be mine forevermore.
